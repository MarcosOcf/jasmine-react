`jasmine-react` provides extensions for the Jasmine Framework for testing React.js applications.

## Why do I need jasmine-react.js?

Let's say you are building an application using Facebook's react.js, and you want to jasmine test your react components - this library helps you do that.  React.js is a very powerful library, but it's architecture puts you one level away from the things you typically need to do in testing: spying on methods in a component; rendering a component without worrying when it'll be asynchronously written to the DOM, using test doubles to isolate each component, etc.
